Note: *The plugin system is a new feature introduced since Falco 0.31.0. You can find more detail in the original [proposal document](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco/blob/master/proposals/20210501-plugin-system.md).*

This repository contains the [Plugin Registry](#plugin-registry) and the [plugins officially maintained](#falcusecurity-plugins) by the Falcosecurity organization. [Plugins](https://falco.org/docs/plugins) can be used to extend [Falco](https://github.com/falcosecurity/falco) and of applications using [Falcosecurity libs](https://github.com/falcosecurity/libs). Please refer to the [official documentation](https://falco.org/docs/plugins) to better understand the plugin system's concepts and architecture. 

## Plugin Registry

The Registry contains metadata and information about every plugin known and recognized by the Falcosecurity organization. It lists plugins hosted either in this repository or in other repositories. These plugins are developed for Falco and made available to the community. Check out the sections below to know how to [register your plugins](#registering-a-new-plugin) and see plugins currently contained in the registry.

### Registering a new Plugin

Registering your plugin inside the registry helps ensure that some technical constraints are respected, such as that a [given ID is used by exactly one source plugin](https://falco.org/docs/plugins/#plugin-event-ids) and allows source plugin authors and extractor plugin authors to [coordinate event source formats](https://falco.org/docs/plugins/#plugin-event-sources-and-interoperability). Moreover, this is a great way to share your plugin project with the community and engage with it, thus gaining new users and **increasing its visibility**. We encourage you to register your plugin in this registry before publishing it. You can add your plugins in this registry regardless of where its source code is hosted (there's a `url` field for this specifically).

The registration process involves adding an entry about your plugin inside the [registry.yaml](./registry.yaml) file by creating a Pull Request in this repository. Please be mindful of a few constraints that are automatically checked and required for your plugin to be accepted:

- The `name` field is mandatory and must be **unique** across all the plugins in the registry
- *(Source plugins only)* The `id` field is mandatory and must be **unique** across all the source plugins in the registry
- The plugin `name` and `source` fields should match this [regular expression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression): `^[a-z]+[a-z0-9_]*$`

For reference, here's an example of a source plugin entry:
```yaml
- id: 2
  source: aws_cloudtrail
  name: cloudtrail
  description: ...
  authors: The Falco Authors
  contact: https://falco.org/community
  url: ...
  license: Apache-2.0
```

You can find the full registry specification here: *(coming soon...)*

### Registered Plugins

The tables below list all the plugins currently registered. The tables are automatically generated from the [registry.yaml](./registry.yaml) file.

## Hosted Plugins 

Another purpose of this repository is to host and maintain the plugins owned by the Falcosecurity organization. Each plugin is a standalone project and has its own directory, and they are all inside the [plugins](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/tree/master/plugins) folder.

The `master` branch contains the most up-to-date state of development, and each plugin is regularly released. Please check our [Release Process](./release.md) to know how plugins are released and how artifacts are distributed. Dev builds are published each time a Pull Request gets merged into `master`, whereas stable builds are released and published only when a new release gets tagged. You can find the published artifacts at https://download.falco.org/?prefix=plugins.

If you wish to contribute your plugin to the Falcosecurity organization, you just need to open a Pull Request to add it inside the `plugins` folder and to add it inside the registry. In order to be hosted in this repository, plugins must be licensed under the [Apache 2.0 License](./LICENSE).
