# Kubernetes Audit Events Plugin

## Introduction

This plugin extends Falco to support [Kubernetes Audit Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/#audit-backends) as a new data source.
Audit events are logged by the API server when almost every cluster management task is performed. By monitoring the audit logs, this plugins provides high visibility over the activity in your cluster allows detecting malicious behavior.

Support for Kubernetes Audit Events was previously introduced in Falco v0.13 as a parallel independent stream of events that was read separately from system calls, and was matched separately against its own sets of rules.
This legacy implementation resided in the Falco codebase and hooked into many points of libsinsp. This plugin is a direct porting of that feature by leveraging the Falco Plugin System introduced in [Falco 0.31](https://falco.org/blog/falco-0-31-0/).
The plugin implementation is a 1-1 porting of the legacy implementation supported by Falco, with few breaking changes introduced to solve few cases of ambiguous behavior and to comply to the constraints of libsinsp and the plugin system.

### Functionality

This plugin supports consuming Kubernetes Audit Events coming from the [Webhook backend](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug/debug-cluster/audit/#webhook-backend) or from file. For webhooks, the plugin embeds a webserver that listens on a configurable port and accepts POST requests. The posted JSON object comprises one or more events. The webserver of the plugin can be configuted as part of the plugin's init configuration and open parameters. For files, the plugins expects content to be [in JSONL format](https://jsonlines.org/), where each line represents a JSON object, containing one or more audit events.

The expected way of using the plugin is through Webhook. The file reading support is mostly designed for testing purposes and for development, but does not represent a concrete deployment use case.

## Capabilities

The `k8saudit` plugin implements both the event sourcing and the field extraction capabilities of the Falco Plugin System.

### Event Source

The event source for Kubernetes Audit Events is `k8s_audit`.

## Usage

### Configuration

Here's an example of configuration of `falco.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: k8saudit
    library_path: libk8saudit.so
    init_config:
      sslCertificate: /etc/falco/falco.pem
    open_params: "http://:9765/k8s-audit"
  - name: json
    library_path: libjson.so
    init_config: ""

load_plugins: [k8saudit, json]
```

**Initialization Config**:
- `sslCertificate`: The SSL Certificate to be used with the HTTPS Webhook endpoint (Default: /etc/falco/falco.pem)
- `maxEventSize`: Maximum size of single audit event (Default: 262144)
- `webhookMaxBatchSize`: Maximum size of incoming webhook POST request bodies (Default: 12582912)
- `useAsync`: If true then async extraction optimization is enabled (Default: true)

**Open Parameters**:
- `http://<host>:<port>/<endpoint>`: Opens an event stream by listening on a HTTP webserver
- `https://<host>:<port>/<endpoint>`: Opens an event stream by listening on a HTTPS webserver
- `no scheme`: Opens an event stream by reading the events from a file on the local filesystem. The params string is interpreted as a filepath


### Rules

The `k8saudit` plugin ships with a default set of ruleset (see `rules/` directory).
The official ruleset depends on the `json` plugin, which motivates its presence in the `falco.yaml` sample showed above.

### Running

This plugin requires Falco with version >= **0.32.0**.
```shell
falco -c falco.yaml -r k8s_audit_rules.yaml
```
```shell
