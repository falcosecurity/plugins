# Kubernetes Audit Events Plugin for AKS

## Introduction

This plugin extends Falco to support [Kubernetes Audit Events](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/#audit-backends) from AWS AKS clusters as a new data source.
For more details about what Audit logs are, see the [README of k8saudit plugin](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/blob/main/plugins/k8saudit/README.md).

### Functionality

This plugin supports consuming Kubernetes Audit Events stored in Azure Event Hub for the AKS Clusters, see [Azure official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/aks/monitor-aks#aks-control-planeresource-logs) for details.

## Capabilities

The `k8saudit-aks` uses the field extraction methods of the [`k8saudit`](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/tree/main/plugins/k8saudit) plugin as the format for the Audit Logs is same.

### Event Source

The event source for Kubernetes Audit Events from AKS is `k8s_audit`, it allows to use same rules than `k8saudit` plugin.

### Supported Fields

Here is the current set of supported fields (from `k8saudit` plugin's extractor):

## Usage

### Configuration

Here's an example of configuration of `falco.yaml`:

```yaml
plugins:
  - name: k8saudit-aks
    library_path: libk8saudit-aks.so
    init_config:
      event_hub_namespace_connection_string: "xxxx"
      event_hub_name: "<my-hub>"
      blob_storage_connection_string: "xxxxx"
      blob_storage_container_name: "<container-name>"
      rate_limit_events_per_second: 100
      rate_limit_burst: 200
    open_params: "my-cluster"
  - name: json
    library_path: libjson.so
    init_config: ""

load_plugins: [k8saudit-aks, json]
```

**Initialization Config**:
* `event_hub_namespace_connection_string`: The connection string of the EventHub Namespace to read from
* `event_hub_name`: The name of the EventHub to read from
* `blob_storage_connection_string`: The connection string of the Blob Storage to use as checkpoint store
* `blob_storage_container_name`: The name of the Blob Storage container to use as checkpoint store
* `rate_limit_events_per_second`: The rate limit of events per second to read from EventHub
* `rate_limit_burst`: The rate limit burst of events to read from EventHub

**Open Parameters**

### Rules

The `k8saudit-aks` plugin ships with no default rule for test purpose, you can use the same rules than those for `k8saudit` plugin. See [here](https://github.com/falcosecurity/plugins/blob/main/plugins/k8saudit/rules/k8s_audit_rules.yaml).

To test if it works anyway, you can still use this one for example:

```yaml
- required_engine_version: 15
- required_plugin_versions:
  - name: k8saudit-aks
    version: 0.1.0

- rule: Dummy rule
  desc: >
    Dummy rule
  condition: >
    ka.verb in (get,create,delete,update)
  output: user=%ka.user.name verb=%ka.verb target=%ka.target.name target.namespace=%ka.target.namespace resource=%ka.target.resource
  priority: WARNING
  source: k8s_audit
  tags: [k8s]
```
